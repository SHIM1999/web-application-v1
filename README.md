# MBTI Quick Test Web App

This project contains a fully client-side MBTI test with forty unique questions. Questions are stored in `question-library.js` and loaded into the main script. Users first choose a language and enter their name, then answer all questions to receive their MBTI type and description in the selected language. Results include the entered name and can be printed directly from the browser.
